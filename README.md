# learning_pytest

## ðŸ“– The Story Behind This Project

My brother recently decided he wanted to learn how to program, and I suggested starting with Python.
To help him learn, Iâ€™ve been giving him tasks to solve.
Initially, I would check his solutions manually, but this became time-consuming. 

One day, while taking a Python exam, I wondered how teachers manage to check so many submissions efficiently. Thatâ€™s when I discovered **pytest**, a tool for automated testing. Inspired by this, I decided to create a project that:
1. Provides Python exercises for my brother to practice.
2. Automatically checks his solutions using pytest so I donâ€™t have to review them manually.

This project is both a learning opportunity for my brother and a chance for me to deepen my understanding of pytest. Itâ€™s a win-win!

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

1. **For my brother:**  
   Provide a structured way to learn Python by solving practical exercises and receiving immediate feedback.
   
2. **For me:**  
   Learn and apply pytest to automate solution validation and streamline the process of teaching programming.

first learning unit is done you can test it out.

remember to install pytest before you test the files
